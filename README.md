The `1alyze` project is meant to make it easier for people to check the numbers reported in tables of research papers. Are they suspect or not? We help you find out.

## How does it work?

1. You take a screenshot of the table you're interested in.
2. You process the screenshot
3. You check the data for correctness
4. You select the data you want to analyze
5. Select the method of analysis
6. Look at the results

It's that easy.

## How do you prevent abuse of this?

We log all analyses conducted. This means that if there's cherry-picking of results, you'll know.

<!-- ## Getting Started

Run your app in the development mode.

```
blitz dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Environment Variables

Ensure the `.env.local` file has required environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<YOUR_DB_USERNAME>@localhost:5432/1alyze
```

Ensure the `.env.test.local` file has required environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<YOUR_DB_USERNAME>@localhost:5432/1alyze_test
```

## Tests
